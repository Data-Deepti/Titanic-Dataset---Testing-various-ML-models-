# Titanic-Dataset---Testing-various-ML-models-

🔍 Exploration and Preprocessing:
I began by exploring the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying potential features.

🤖 Model Selection:
Experimented with a range of ML models.
  1. Naive_Bayes
  2. Logistic_Regression
  3. SVC
  4. Random_Forest
  5. K_Neighbor
  
📈 Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluated the models using accuracy scores, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their performance. 

🎯 Results and Takeaways:
Random_Forest has the highest accuracy score .

The journey through this competition not only enhanced my practical ML skills but also highlighted the importance of feature engineering and model selection.
